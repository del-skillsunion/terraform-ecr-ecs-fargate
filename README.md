# Building and Deploying a Docker Application with Terraform and Amazon ECS

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on building a Docker application, pushing it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), deploying it to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using Terraform, and handling common errors.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions.
- Docker installed on your local machine. You can download Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download Terraform from [Terraform's official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

## Docker Image Creation and Push

1. **Set Up the Docker Image:**

   - Create a directory for your Docker project and navigate to it in your terminal:

     ```sh
     mkdir tf-sample-application-image
     cd tf-sample-application-image
     ```

   - Inside this directory, create a `Dockerfile` with the content in the [example Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

   - Build the Docker image locally:

     ```sh
     docker build -t tf-sample-application-image .
     ```

2. **Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR:**

   - Log in to Amazon ECR using the AWS CLI:

     ```sh
     aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
     ```

   - Tag the Docker image with your ECR repository URI:

     ```sh
     docker tag tf-sample-application-image:latest 255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tf-sample-application:latest
     ```

   - Push the tagged Docker image to Amazon ECR:

     ```sh
     docker push 255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tf-sample-application:latest
     ```

## ECS Deployment Using Terraform

1. **Set Up the Terraform Configuration:**

   - Create a `terraform.tf` file in your project directory and add the Terraform configuration from the [example Terraform configuration](./terraform.tf).

2. **Deploy ECS Service:**

   - Run the following Terraform commands to deploy the ECS service:

     ```sh
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```

## Resource Destruction

1. **Destroy Resources:**

   - If you no longer need the resources, navigate to the project directory and run:

     ```sh
     terraform destroy
     ```

## Handling ECR Image Deletion Error

1. **If You Encounter Deletion Error:**

   - If you encounter an error when trying to delete an ECR image with a specific tag, such as `latest`, you can use the following AWS CLI command to forcefully delete it:

     ```sh
     aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name tf-sample-application --image-ids imageTag=latest
     ```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to build a Docker image, push it to Amazon ECR, deploy an ECS service using Terraform, and manage resources effectively. This approach provides a streamlined way to manage your containerized applications on AWS.
